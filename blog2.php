        <p>Who among us hasn't needed a break from work? No matter how much you may love your job, sometimes you have to get away from it. You might put in for a vacation day or a personal day, 
        depending on your company's policies and procedures. You might even 
        <a href="https://money.usnews.com/money/careers/company-culture/articles/how-to-call-in-sick">call in sick</a>. 
        What you are really taking, though, is a mental health day off.</p>
        <p>Self-care is anything you do to take care of yourself so you can stay physically, mentally, and emotionally well. 
            Its benefits are better physical, mental, and emotional health and well-being. Research suggests self-care promotes positive health 
            outcomes, such as fostering resilience, living longer, and becoming better equipped to manage stress.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Take a Day</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Once you have decided to take a mental health day, the question then becomes "when and how?"</p><br>
        <p>The best way to avoid feeling stressed about taking a day off is to schedule a day off ahead of time, 
            ensuring that you've taken steps to rearrange your workload or find a replacement for the day. 
            However, if you wake up in the morning and just feel that you can't face the stress of the day, 
            this may be a good time to take a mental health day and make the most of it.</p>
            <p>The decision of when to take a mental health day really depends on your personal situation. 
                If your employer is supportive and you are comfortable sharing your reasons, feel free to plan a mental health day out in advance. 
                If you don't want to divulge your reasons for taking a day or if your employer is less understanding, don't feel obligated to share.</p>
